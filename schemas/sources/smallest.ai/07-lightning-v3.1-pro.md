# Lightning v3.1 Pro

> Model card for Lightning v3.1 Pro. Premium 44.1 kHz TTS pool with a curated voice catalog across American, British, and Indian accents, English + Hindi code-switching, 31 supported languages plus `auto` routing, and improved naturalness.

Latest Release

Lightning v3.1 Pro is a premium 44.1 kHz text-to-speech pool with improved naturalness and a curated voice catalog. Runs on dedicated inference capacity, isolated from general traffic. Concurrency, latency, and rate limits are identical to standard Lightning v3.1; the difference is voice quality and the catalog.

## Key Capabilities

Ultra-low latency architecture designed for conversational AI and live streaming.

HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports for real-time playback.

`language: en` → UK + American accented English. `language: hi` → Indian accented English + Hindi (code-switching). Omit → defaults to `en + hi`. Plus 29 additional languages via dedicated Pro voices - pass the ISO 639-1 code (e.g. `ta`, `de`, `ja`), or use `auto` for cross-language routing.

Broadcast-quality 44.1 kHz audio with natural prosody, intonation, and conversational rhythm.

Premium voices across American, British, and Indian accents.

Custom pronunciation dictionaries for specialized vocabulary, brand names, and domain-specific terms.

## Performance & Benchmarks

Pro improves on standard Lightning v3.1 across accuracy, expressiveness, delivery, and MOS quality. Tables below pair Pro with the same competitor set documented on the [Lightning v3.1 model card](/models/model-cards/text-to-speech/lightning-v-3-1); refer to that card for Pro-vs-Standard comparisons. Open the accordion under each category to see what each metric measures.

**Where 200 ms TTFB comes from.** Measured from a client in the same AWS region as the inference pool (India `ap-south-1`, USA `us-west-2`, geo-routed by client location). Client-to-server round-trip time adds on top. A naive test from a laptop far from either region typically reports 500-800 ms because RTT dominates synthesis time. For a production-realistic number, measure from your production network position, not your dev machine.

#### What each Naturalness metric measures

* **Overall** - Holistic listener rating of how natural the voice sounds end-to-end.
* **Naturalness** - How human-like the voice sounds; penalizes robotic or synthetic quality.
* **Intonation** - Whether pitch rises and falls appropriately for the sentence type (question, statement, exclamation).
* **Prosody** - The broader umbrella of rhythm, stress, and melody, how well the voice "reads" the sentence as a human would.

#### What each Expressiveness metric measures

* **Overall** - Holistic listener rating of how expressive the voice sounds given the context of the sentence.
* **Paralinguistics** - Non-verbal vocal elements like laughter, sighs, or filler sounds ("um", "uh") and whether they're rendered appropriately.
* **Emotions** - How accurately the voice conveys the intended emotional tone (neutral, warm, urgent, etc.).

#### What each Delivery metric measures

* **Boundary Consistency** - Whether phrase and sentence boundaries are marked consistently with pauses or pitch shifts, without arbitrary breaks mid-phrase.
* **Pronunciation Style** - Not just correctness, but stylistic choices i.e., formal vs. casual register, regional accent consistency, honorific handling.
* **Natural Pace** - Whether the speaking rate feels comfortable and appropriate for the content type, neither rushed nor dragging.
* **Pause Placement** - Whether silences appear at semantically correct points (after commas, between clauses) rather than mid-word or mid-phrase.
* **Breathing Naturalness** - Whether breath sounds occur at realistic points and with realistic frequency, not absent entirely or inserted randomly.

### Accuracy

Mixed direction - WER, CER, Hallucination, and Deletion are *lower is better*; Pronunciation % is *higher is better*.

#### What each Accuracy metric measures

* **WER (Word Error Rate)** - Percentage of words in the transcript that differ from the reference; measures how faithfully the TTS renders the input text.
* **CER (Character Error Rate)** - Like WER but at the character level.
* **Hallucination** - Words or sounds the TTS generates that have no basis in the input text. Insertions, substitutions, or fabricated content.
* **Deletion** - Words from the reference text that the TTS dropped entirely.
* **Pronunciation %** - The proportion of words pronounced correctly out of total words.
* **Whisper jiwer vs Whisper LLM** - Two judging methodologies. `jiwer` uses raw Whisper-decoded transcripts; LLM-judged uses a follow-on LLM to normalize transcription noise. Both report the same metric family; LLM-judged tends to give lower error rates by reducing false positives from punctuation/casing.

#### What each MOS metric measures

* **Mean MOS** - Mean Opinion Score: average listener rating on a 1–5 scale across the test set; the canonical aggregate quality metric in TTS evaluation.
* **UTMOS** - A predicted MOS from the UTMOS reference model - an automated proxy for subjective quality.
* **WV-MOS** - A predicted MOS from the WavLM-based WV-MOS reference model - another automated proxy commonly reported alongside UTMOS for cross-validation.

| `language` value                                                     | Behaviour                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `hi`                                                                 | Indian accented English + Hindi (mid-utterance code-switching). Best paired with Indian Pro voices.  |
| ISO 639-1 code of an additional Pro language (e.g. `ta`, `de`, `ja`) | Native synthesis in that language. Pair with a Pro voice from that language's catalog section below. |
| *omitted*                                                            | Defaults to `en + hi` - mixed Indian + Western English coverage.                                     |

### Additional Pro languages

29 additional languages have dedicated Pro voices. Pass the ISO 639-1 code in the `language` body parameter and pick a `voice_id` from the matching [Voice Catalog](#voice-catalog) section. Pass `auto` to route across all supported languages using any English or Hindi voice.

Dutch and Swedish accept the codes on Pro; voice-count data pending as new Pro voice trains for those roll out.

For other languages, use the standard [Lightning v3.1](/models/model-cards/text-to-speech/lightning-v-3-1) model (20 accepted codes; 12 with a trained voice catalog).

Need a voice not in this list? Use the standard [Lightning v3.1](/models/model-cards/text-to-speech/lightning-v-3-1) catalog (217 voices, more languages). Pass `"model": "lightning_v3.1"` (or omit the field) instead of `lightning_v3.1_pro`. Both pools support voice cloning.

## Best Practices

### Voice ID + model pairing

Pair Pro voice IDs above with `"model": "lightning_v3.1_pro"`. The API does not currently reject mismatched pairings, but pairing a Pro voice with `"model": "lightning_v3.1"` (or omitting `model`) can produce wrong or hallucinated audio. Server-side validation is on the roadmap.

### Language selection

* **`language: en`** → UK + American accented English. Pair with British or American Pro voices for best results.
* **`language: hi`** → Indian accented English + Hindi with native code-switching mid-utterance. Pair with Indian Pro voices.
* **Any additional Pro language** (e.g. `language: ta`, `language: de`, `language: ja`) → native synthesis in that language. Always pair with a Pro voice from that language's [Voice Catalog](#voice-catalog) section.
* **Omit `language`** → defaults to `en + hi`. Sensible when you don't know the input language ahead of time.

Per-voice metadata still lives in `tags.language` on the voice catalog (`GET /waves/v1/lightning-v3.1/get_voices`). The body parameter sets the *target* language for the synthesis pass; the voice ID controls the timbre and accent of the speaker.

### Text Formatting

* **Chunk boundaries.** Segment input at natural prosodic boundaries (`.` `!` `?` `,`). Maximum chunk size is 250 characters; optimal throughput at 140 characters per request.
* **Script integrity.** Use native script for each language. Mixed-script input within a single language token produces unpredictable phoneme mappings.
* **Lexicon overrides.** Use [pronunciation dictionaries](/models/documentation/text-to-speech-lightning/pronunciation-dictionaries) for domain-specific terms, brand names, and acronyms where default grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is insufficient.

For comprehensive text formatting rules (numeric handling, date/time, symbols, chunking logic), see [TTS Best Practices](/models/documentation/best-practices/tts-best-practices).

## FAQ

#### How is Lightning v3.1 Pro different from standard Lightning v3.1?

Pro runs on dedicated inference capacity, isolated from general Lightning traffic, and ships a curated premium voice catalog with improved naturalness. Concurrency, latency, and rate-limit ceilings are identical to standard [Lightning v3.1](/models/model-cards/text-to-speech/lightning-v-3-1) - the difference is voice quality and the catalog.

#### How do I route requests to the Pro pool?

Set `model` to `lightning_v3.1_pro` explicitly. The field is optional, but it defaults to standard Lightning v3.1 - for Pro you must pass it on every request.

#### Can I pair any voice with the Pro model?

Pair Pro voice IDs with `"model": "lightning_v3.1_pro"`. The API does not currently reject mismatched pairings, but pairing a Pro voice with `"model": "lightning_v3.1"` (or omitting `model`) can produce wrong or hallucinated audio. Server-side validation is on the roadmap.

#### Does Lightning v3.1 Pro support voice cloning?

Yes. Pass `model: lightning-v3.1-pro` to the [voice-cloning API](/models/capabilities/voice-cloning/how-to-vc-api) to clone onto the Pro pool, then use the resulting `voice_id` with TTS `model: lightning_v3.1_pro`. The default is `lightning-v3.1`.

#### Which languages does Lightning v3.1 Pro support?

Set `language: en` for UK + American accented English, or `language: hi` for Indian accented English + Hindi with native code-switching. Omitting `language` defaults to `en + hi`.

#### Are word-level timestamps supported on Pro voices?

Pro shares the Lightning v3.1 base-queue voices for English + Hindi (`meher`, `devansh`, `kartik`, `maithili`, `liam`, `avery`), so word events emit on those. Other Pro-only voices fall back to silent graceful degradation - audio is normal, but no word events are emitted.

---

## Safety & Compliance

### Known Limitations

* **Larger, curated catalog on standard v3.1.** The Pro catalog is intentionally smaller. For the widest voice selection and more languages, use standard [Lightning v3.1](/models/model-cards/text-to-speech/lightning-v-3-1).

Lightning v3.1 Pro must **not** be used for impersonation or fraud, generating deceptive audio content (deepfakes), creating content that violates consent or privacy, harassment or abuse, or any illegal or unethical purposes.

### Compliance

* No retention of synthesized audio
* Usage monitoring for policy compliance

For compliance documentation (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA), contact [support@smallest.ai](mailto:support@smallest.ai).

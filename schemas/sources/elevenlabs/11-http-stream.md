# Stream speech

POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}/stream
Content-Type: application/json

Converts text into speech using a voice of your choice and returns audio as an audio stream.

Reference: https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech/stream

## Servers

- `https://api.elevenlabs.io` (Production, default)
- `https://api.us.elevenlabs.io` (Production US)
- `https://api.eu.residency.elevenlabs.io` (Production EU)
- `https://api.in.residency.elevenlabs.io` (Production India)
- `https://api.sg.residency.elevenlabs.io` (Production Singapore)

## Request

### Path parameters

- `voice_id` (string, required) — ID of the voice to be used. Use the [Get voices](/docs/api-reference/voices/search) endpoint list all the available voices.

### Query parameters

- `enable_logging` (boolean, optional, default: true) — When enable_logging is set to false zero retention mode will be used for the request. This will mean history features are unavailable for this request, including request stitching. Zero retention mode may only be used by enterprise customers.
- `optimize_streaming_latency` (integer, optional, nullable, deprecated) — You can turn on latency optimizations at some cost of quality. The best possible final latency varies by model. Possible values: 0 - default mode (no latency optimizations) 1 - normal latency optimizations (about 50% of possible latency improvement of option 3) 2 - strong latency optimizations (about 75% of possible latency improvement of option 3) 3 - max latency optimizations 4 - max latency optimizations, but also with text normalizer turned off for even more latency savings (best latency, but can mispronounce eg numbers and dates). Defaults to None.
- `output_format` (enum, optional, default: mp3_44100_128) — Output format of the generated audio. Formatted as codec_sample_rate_bitrate. So an mp3 with 22.05kHz sample rate at 32kbs is represented as mp3_22050_32. MP3 with 192kbps bitrate requires you to be subscribed to Creator tier or above. PCM with 44.1kHz sample rate requires you to be subscribed to Pro tier or above. Note that the μ-law format (sometimes written mu-law, often approximated as u-law) is commonly used for Twilio audio inputs.
  - Allowed values: `mp3_22050_32`, `mp3_24000_48`, `mp3_44100_32`, `mp3_44100_64`, `mp3_44100_96`, `mp3_44100_128`, `mp3_44100_192`, `pcm_8000`, `pcm_16000`, `pcm_22050`, `pcm_24000`, `pcm_32000`, `pcm_44100`, `pcm_48000`, `ulaw_8000`, `alaw_8000`, `opus_48000_32`, `opus_48000_64`, `opus_48000_96`, `opus_48000_128`, `opus_48000_192`

### Body (application/json)

- `text` (string, required) — The text that will get converted into speech.
- `model_id` (string, optional, default: eleven_multilingual_v2) — Identifier of the model that will be used, you can query them using GET /v1/models. The model needs to have support for text to speech, you can check this using the can_do_text_to_speech property.
- `language_code` (string, optional, nullable) — Language code (ISO 639-1) used to enforce a language for the model and text normalization. If the model does not support the provided language code, it will be ignored. This parameter is not supported for multilingual_v2 models.
- `voice_settings` (object, optional, nullable) — Voice settings overriding stored settings for the given voice. They are applied only on the given request.
  - `stability` (double, optional, nullable, default: 0.5) — Determines how stable the voice is and the randomness between each generation. Lower values introduce broader emotional range for the voice. Higher values can result in a monotonous voice with limited emotion.
  - `use_speaker_boost` (boolean, optional, nullable, default: true) — This setting boosts the similarity to the original speaker. Using this setting requires a slightly higher computational load, which in turn increases latency.
  - `similarity_boost` (double, optional, nullable, default: 0.75) — Determines how closely the AI should adhere to the original voice when attempting to replicate it.
  - `style` (double, optional, nullable, default: 0) — Determines the style exaggeration of the voice. This setting attempts to amplify the style of the original speaker. It does consume additional computational resources and might increase latency if set to anything other than 0.
  - `speed` (double, optional, nullable, default: 1) — Adjusts the speed of the voice. A value of 1.0 is the default speed, while values less than 1.0 slow down the speech, and values greater than 1.0 speed it up.
- `pronunciation_dictionary_locators` (list of object, optional, nullable) — A list of pronunciation dictionary locators (id, version_id) to be applied to the text. They will be applied in order. You may have up to 3 locators per request
  - `pronunciation_dictionary_id` (string, required) — The ID of the pronunciation dictionary.
  - `version_id` (string, optional, nullable) — The ID of the version of the pronunciation dictionary. If not provided, the latest version will be used.
- `seed` (integer, optional, nullable) — If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed. Must be integer between 0 and 4294967295.
- `previous_text` (string, optional, nullable) — The text that came before the text of the current request. Can be used to improve the speech's continuity when concatenating together multiple generations or to influence the speech's continuity in the current generation.
- `next_text` (string, optional, nullable) — The text that comes after the text of the current request. Can be used to improve the speech's continuity when concatenating together multiple generations or to influence the speech's continuity in the current generation.
- `previous_request_ids` (list of string, optional, nullable) — A list of request_id of the samples that were generated before this generation. Can be used to improve the speech's continuity when splitting up a large task into multiple requests. The results will be best when the same model is used across the generations. In case both previous_text and previous_request_ids is send, previous_text will be ignored. A maximum of 3 request_ids can be send.
- `next_request_ids` (list of string, optional, nullable) — A list of request_id of the samples that come after this generation. next_request_ids is especially useful for maintaining the speech's continuity when regenerating a sample that has had some audio quality issues. For example, if you have generated 3 speech clips, and you want to improve clip 2, passing the request id of clip 3 as a next_request_id (and that of clip 1 as a previous_request_id) will help maintain natural flow in the combined speech. The results will be best when the same model is used across the generations. In case both next_text and next_request_ids is send, next_text will be ignored. A maximum of 3 request_ids can be send.
- `apply_text_normalization` (enum, optional, default: auto) — This parameter controls text normalization with three modes: 'auto', 'on', and 'off'. When set to 'auto', the system will automatically decide whether to apply text normalization (e.g., spelling out numbers). With 'on', text normalization will always be applied, while with 'off', it will be skipped.
  - Allowed values: `auto`, `on`, `off`
- `apply_language_text_normalization` (boolean, optional, default: false) — This parameter controls language text normalization. This helps with proper pronunciation of text in some supported languages. WARNING: This parameter can heavily increase the latency of the request. Currently only supported for Japanese.
- `use_pvc_as_ivc` (boolean, optional, default: false, deprecated) — If true, we won't use PVC version of the voice for the generation but the IVC version. This is a temporary workaround for higher latency in PVC versions.

# Multi-Context WebSocket

GET /v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}/multi-stream-input

The Multi-Context Text-to-Speech WebSockets API allows for generating audio from text input
while managing multiple independent audio generation streams (contexts) over a single WebSocket connection.
This is useful for scenarios requiring concurrent or interleaved audio generations, such as dynamic
conversational AI applications.

Each context, identified by a context id, maintains its own state. You can send text to specific
contexts, flush them, or close them independently. A `close_socket` message can be used to terminate
the entire connection gracefully.

For more information on best practices for how to use this API, please see the [multi context websocket guide](/docs/eleven-api/guides/how-to/websockets/multi-context-web-socket).

            This is an advanced setting that most users shouldn't need to use.
            It relates to our

            generation schedule.


            Our WebSocket service incorporates a buffer system designed to
            optimize the Time To First Byte (TTFB) while maintaining
            high-quality streaming.


            All text sent to the WebSocket endpoint is added to this buffer and
            only when that buffer reaches a certain size is an audio generation
            attempted. This is because our model provides higher quality audio
            when the model has longer inputs, and can deduce more context about
            how the text should be delivered.


            The buffer ensures smooth audio data delivery and is automatically
            emptied with a final audio generation either when the stream is
            closed, or upon sending a `flush` command. We have advanced settings
            for changing the chunk schedule, which can improve latency at the
            cost of quality by generating audio more frequently with smaller
            text inputs.


            The `chunk_length_schedule` determines the minimum amount of text
            that needs to be sent and present in our

            buffer before audio starts being generated. This is to maximise the
            amount of context available to

            the model to improve audio quality, whilst balancing latency of the
            returned audio chunks.


            The default value for `chunk_length_schedule` is: [120, 160, 250,
            290].


            This means that the first chunk of audio will not be generated until
            you send text that

            totals at least 120 characters long. The next chunk of audio will
            only be generated once a

            further 160 characters have been sent. The third audio chunk will be
            generated after the

            next 250 characters. Then the fourth, and beyond, will be generated
            in sets of at least 290 characters.


            Customize this array to suit your needs. If you want to generate
            audio more frequently

            to optimise latency, you can reduce the values in the array. Note
            that setting the values

            too low may result in lower quality audio. Please test and adjust as
            needed.


            Each item should be in the range 50-500.
